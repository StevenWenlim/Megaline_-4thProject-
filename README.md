# Project Overview

As an analyst at Megaline Operator, I was asked to perform an initial analysis on their prepaid packages My goal is to analyze customer behavior and determine which prepaid package brings in more revenue, so the marketing department have a basis and consideration to set advertising budget.

Based on the observation and visualization, here are some findings that I obtained :
1. It is known that both hypotheses is correct that there is a difference in the amount of revenue between the Surf and Ultimate plans, as well as a difference in the amount of revenue from users who come from NY-NJ and other areas.
2. Based on the visualization, the number of Surf plan users tends to increase every month. It can be concluded that the Surf plan is quite cheap and more suitable for users' needs in NY-NJ and other areas.
3. If the revenue is calculated based on the additional costs incurred if there is excessive usage of the Surf plan, it does bring in higher revenue in all areas. However, if calculated based on the total revenue, the Ultimate plan earns higher revenue.

Based on the analysis, the marketing team can consider the following recommendations:

The marketing department focuses their advertising budget on the Ultimate plan. Although the Surf plan has a lower cost and is more popular in NY-NJ and other areas, the revenue from the Ultimate plan is higher when calculated based on total revenue. Additionally, the number of Surf plan users is already increasing every month, suggesting that it does not require as much advertising attention as the Ultimate plan. The marketing department can also consider offering promotions or incentives for customers to switch to the Ultimate plan to further increase revenue
